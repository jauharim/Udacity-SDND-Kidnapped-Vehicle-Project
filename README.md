Writeup: My pdf writeup for this project

For the project; we had to write the C++ code in the particle_filter.cpp file to implement the functions for the particle filter class. 
These functions were:
Initialization for the filter
Prediction for the filter
Data Association
Update each particleâ€™s weight
Resampling

Rest of the files ( including map data) were provided by Udacity.
